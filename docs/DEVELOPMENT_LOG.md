## Development Notes

### **Architectural Decisions**
- **Tauri over Electron**: Better performance, smaller binaries, Rust security benefits
- **Local-First**: SQLite over cloud databases for student data control
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging
- **Multiple Checksums**: SHA-256 (security), MD5 (compatibility), BLAKE3 (performance)

### **Key Challenges Resolved**
1. **PWA Contradiction**: Successfully migrated from invalid PWA/Node hybrid to Tauri
2. **Build Dependencies**: Resolved Linux WebKit and icon generation requirements
3. **Runtime Integration**: Fixed frontend/backend communication and path configuration
4. **React Performance**: Eliminated infinite loops with proper hook dependencies

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Compilation**: All TypeScript and Rust code compiles without errors
- **Runtime**: Desktop application launches and displays properly
- **UI Functionality**: Drag-and-drop interface responds correctly
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between frontend, backend, and data layers

## Next Steps (Post Phase 1)

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **Database Integration**: Re-enable full database functionality
2. **Real File Operations**: Transition from mock data to actual BagIt creation
3. **Student Testing**: Deploy to 3-5 art students for user validation
4. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize file handling for large projects

### **Phase 2 Planning**
