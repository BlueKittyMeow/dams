# CWPT Phase 1 - Executive Summary for Management

## Project Overview - What We Built

**Creative Work Preservation Toolkit (CWPT)** - A desktop application that helps art students safely archive their completed projects using professional museum-quality standards.

**Think of it like**: A specialized "backup program" that not only saves files but also creates a professional preservation package that meets the same standards used by libraries and museums to preserve digital artifacts long-term.

---

## Phase 1 Accomplishments - What We Delivered

### ✅ **Working Desktop Application**
**What this means**: Students can now download and run a program on their computer (like Photoshop or Word) that has a simple drag-and-drop interface for archiving their art projects.

**Technical Achievement**: We built a complete desktop application from scratch using modern, professional-grade tools.

### ✅ **Professional User Interface**
**What this means**: The app looks and feels like professional software - clean, modern, and easy to use. Students can simply drag files into the window and the app handles everything else.

**Technical Achievement**: Created a responsive, modern web-style interface using React (a popular framework used by Facebook, Netflix, etc.) with professional styling.

### ✅ **Industry-Standard Preservation**
**What this means**: When students archive their work, it creates packages that follow the same standards used by the Library of Congress, Smithsonian, and other major institutions for preserving digital materials.

**Technical Achievement**: Full implementation of BagIt specification - this is the gold standard for digital preservation used worldwide.

## Technical Stack Explained (For Your Boss)

### **Why We Chose Tauri (Desktop Framework)**
- **Business Benefit**: Creates a single installer file that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **Technical Benefit**: Combines the security of native desktop apps with the ease of web development
- **Comparison**: Like Electron (used by Slack, Discord) but smaller, faster, and more secure
- **Why It Matters**: Students get a professional desktop experience without us having to build separate apps for each operating system

### **Why We Chose React (User Interface)**
- **Business Benefit**: Modern, responsive interface that students already know how to use
- **Technical Benefit**: Industry-standard framework used by major companies
- **Comparison**: Like the technology behind Facebook's interface
- **Why It Matters**: Fast development, easy maintenance, professional appearance

### **Why We Chose Rust (Backend Logic)**
- **Business Benefit**: Extremely secure and fast - no crashes or security vulnerabilities
- **Technical Benefit**: Memory-safe systems programming language
- **Comparison**: Like C++ but impossible to have memory leaks or buffer overflows
- **Why It Matters**: The file handling operations are bulletproof - student data is protected

### **Why We Chose SQLite (Data Storage)**
- **Business Benefit**: No server costs, works offline, student data stays on their machine
- **Technical Benefit**: Self-contained database that requires no setup or administration
- **Comparison**: Like having a mini-database built into the app (used by smartphones, browsers)
- **Why It Matters**: Simple for students, no privacy concerns, no ongoing costs

## Standards Compliance - Why This Matters

### **BagIt v1.0 Specification**
- **What It Is**: The international standard for packaging digital files for long-term preservation
- **Who Uses It**: Library of Congress, National Archives, university libraries, museums worldwide
- **Business Value**: Students' work will be readable and usable decades from now
- **Technical Achievement**: Full compliance with 20+ pages of technical specifications

### **Multiple Checksum Validation**
- **What It Is**: Mathematical "fingerprints" of files that detect any corruption or changes
- **Why Three Types**:
  - SHA-256: Bank-level security standard
  - MD5: Compatibility with older systems
  - BLAKE3: Cutting-edge performance for large files
- **Business Value**: Guarantees file integrity - students know their work is exactly as they saved it
- **Technical Achievement**: Comprehensive data integrity verification system

### **Dublin Core Metadata**
- **What It Is**: Standard way of describing digital objects (like library catalog cards)
- **Who Uses It**: Libraries, museums, digital archives worldwide
- **Business Value**: Student work is properly cataloged and searchable
- **Technical Achievement**: Professional metadata management system
